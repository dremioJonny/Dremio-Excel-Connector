# DremioExcelConnector
 
This Excel workbook contains a macro to be able to connect from Excel to Dremio without needing to install an ODBC driver. The use case of this connector should be when you do not have System Admin rights on your local machine. If you have the ability to install the [Dremio ODBC driver](https://www.dremio.com/deploy/) as performance is superior.
